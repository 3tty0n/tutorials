Datasets
--------

The `*gram*` data samples come from [the Google Books NGram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) project,
whose raw datasets are available for free at [https://books.google.com/ngrams/datasets](https://books.google.com/ngrams/datasets).

To generate the samples, download, uncompress and rename the following raw datasets:
* [1gram-a](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/googlebooks-eng-all-1gram-20120701-a.gz)

The `*gram*` data samples were generated with the following commands
* `head -n 97500 1gram-a | tail -n 2000 | egrep -v _ >`**`t1gram.csv`**
