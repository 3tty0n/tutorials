DSL API
=======

We introduce the concepts common to all DSLs built with LMS.

Concepts
--------

Staging
```````

In LMS, a DSL program is split into two stages: the first stage
generates the second stage. The DSL program is partially evaluated
during the first stage -- whether an expression belongs to the first
or second stage is driven by types: expressions of type ``Rep[T]`` may
be deferred to the second stage, while other expressions are evaluated
during the first stage and become constants in the second stage.
