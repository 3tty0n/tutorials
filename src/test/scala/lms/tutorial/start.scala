Staging
-------

What is staging? The idea behind staging is to delay computation of
certain expressions, generating code to compute them later. The
benefit is *abstraction without regret*.

Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS)
---------------------------------

Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) is a staging technique driven by
types. The technique has been implemented in Scala, in a framework to
build compilers.

In addition to the *staging* aspect, the technique is *lightweight*,
because it is purely library based. It is also *modular*, for two
reasons: (1) features can be mixed and matched (2) DSL specification
and implementation are separate.

/**
### Rep[T] vs T

In LMS, `Rep[T]` represents a delayed compuation of type `T`. Thus,
during staging, an expression of type `Rep[T]` becomes part of
the generated code, while an expression of bare type `T` becomes a
constant in the generated code. For core Scala features, adding
`Rep` types should be enough to build a program generator, as we
will see later.

Contrast the snippet on the left, where `b` is a `Boolean`, with
the snippet on the right, where `b` is a `Rep[Boolean]`. The
expression `if (b) 1 else x` is executed at staging time when `b`
is a `Boolean`, while it is delayed causing code to be generated for
the `if` expression when `b` is a `Rep[Boolean]` -- indeed, the
actual value of `b` is not known at staging time, but only when the
generated code is executed.

### Rep[A => B] vs Rep[A]=>Rep[B]

In the previous snippets, we already notice some *abstraction without
regret*: the ``compute`` function exists only at staging time, and is
not part of the generated code -- more generally, we can freely use
abstractions to structure and compose the staged program, but these
abstractions are not part of the generated code when their type is a
bare ``T`` as opposed of a ``Rep[T]``. In the right snippet,
``compute`` has the type ``Rep[Boolean] => Rep[Int]``, not
``Rep[Boolean => Int]`` -- its type already tells us that the function
is known at staging time.
